# Backpack for Laravel Documentation 1

You can find the online version of the Backpack documentation at https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs

### How it works
- the ```master``` branch is the one showing up on https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs
- inside each version folder there's an index.md file, where we store the sidebar menu for that version
- inside each version folder there's an introduction.md file, which is the home page for that version

### Contribution guidelines
- pull requests are welcome and appreciated;
- pull requests should point to the ```master``` branch;
