For Backpack v3.3 documentation, please [download our old documentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f55_5DEHnyGpiRBbCSZzvMTG-X1AG9EV). 

This is a full archive of our old documentation, hosted on readme.io. We're no longer using Readme.io for our documentation, but [our own github repo](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/docs). We've had to deleted our Readme.io account, and remove the results from Google search, because people got to the old docs (which were inaccurate and incomplete) instead of our current docs.
